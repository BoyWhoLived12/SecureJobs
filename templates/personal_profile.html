                    Hello Everyone, I am John Butcher. I am a Post Graduate in Computer Science. I am an Machine
                    Learning and a AI expert. I have worked on many projects related to computer vision and autonomous
                    robots. I am really enthusiastic about the Integration of computer vision and reinforcement
                    learning. Along with this I am also interested in the Block Chain it is a really interesting field
                    and offers s good future scope, the interest shown by people in crypto-currency and the NFTs is a
                    lot more than I ever expected.
